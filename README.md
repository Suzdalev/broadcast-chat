# A Simple chat application based on LAN broadcast UDP messaging.
Console & GUI version provided. GUI version made with Tkinter.

### A How it works
App sends message not to a server, but to broadcast address of your local network. So every node on the network will receive this UDP data.
With every computer on the same network runs this app, everyone is receiving messages sent by anyone. 

### A How to test on same computer
Just launch two instances of an app, and they will be exchanging messages. 


### A Console version
``` python main.py ```


### A GUI version
``` python main_gui.py ```
